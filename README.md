# Exporter
Exporting blender files very fast as a demo render or master export in my pipeline.

**Install just the .py file as an addon and dont be stupid about it**

The N menu has a button, the dialog popup allows you to choose wheter you want to save incrementally before making a sweatbox video.

folder structure:

`Task/Shotnumber/tyPe/Content`
